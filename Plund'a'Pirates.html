				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>This my first ever attempt at a game jam, this one organised by my university, and made with <a
						href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfie-elliott/" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">Alfie Elliott</a>. The
					game was supposed to fit, or otherwise incorporate, a "reveal". We have decided on making metal
					detecting cover that idea, which later evolved into pirates searching for treasure. </p>
				<h2>What have we got so far?</h2>
				<p>The game supports same-screen 2 player PvP, with funcionality for both keyboard and controllers. The
					aim of the game is to search the island you and a friend of yours are placed on, and find more
					treasure than your friend. As of now, the game is unfinished, and doesn't yet contain a win/loss
					state and support for more than 2 players, however we discussed the possibility of finishing this
					game up in the future, and have decided to put it on hold for now.</p>
