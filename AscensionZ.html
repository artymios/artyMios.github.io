				<h2>What is AscensionZ?</h2>
				<p>AscensionZ was my first time using Unreal Engine 4, and my task was to make a fully funtional mock-up
					of a main menu for one of my assignments in Level 5 Computer Games Programming. The result? Me
					spending all my spare time I had when I was working on this project perfecting what I had, because
					of my fascination at the time with UE4, blueprints and animations.</p>
				<h2>Appearance</h2>
				<p>This game was greatly inpsired by <a href="https://vrchat-legends.fandom.com/wiki/Ascension_Academy"
						target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ascension Academy</a>, and the main menu is meant to
					resemble the <a href="images/AA Portal plant.png" target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer">portals</a> that exist in the Academy. Each of the main 5 menu options
					have a camera pan in/out animation when the option is selected or returned from respectively, meant
					to appear as if the player is selecting a destination and walking into the portal. <br><br>
					When an option is being hovered over, the colour of the portal and the lamp above it will change
					according to the hovered option's colour, and a banner with the name of the option will move from
					the previously hovered option and changing the text on it, letting the player know which option they
					are hovering over. The menus themselves have a continuous fade in and out animation, with their
					colour changing to the colour of the just selected option.</p>
				<h2>Functionality</h2>
				<p>From the main menu, you are able to enter a selection of modes, divided between gameplay-realted
					elements on the left side of the menu, and the functional menus on the right. You are able to
					navigate the menus by using WASD/arrow keys on keyboard, or left thumbstick/D-pad on a controller,
					confirm by pressing J/Enter (keyboard) or A/X (Xbox/PS), and return to last menu by pressing K
					(keyboard) or B/O (Xbox/PS). 5 of the 6 main menu options will lead you to a submenu, with the Quit
					option quitting the game when selected. The gameplay options will load the next appropriate scene
					depending on the option selected, while the Credits option will show the credits screen, and the
					Options submenu will show a variety of game options, all fully functional, with a "Use optimal
					settings" button that will automatically adjust the game to best suit the player's hardware.</p>
